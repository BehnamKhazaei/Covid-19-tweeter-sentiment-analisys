# Covid-19-tweeter-sentiment-analisys
This is the project of my first semester of college. 
This project is Done by 3 of my team mates and me. ( Behnam Khazaei - Alex Zhou - Bayron Jose Guevara Calderon - Sherif ELHennawy )
The goal of this project is to predict the feeling of tweets about covid-19. 
First we have made the model with a manually clered dataset. Then we made the model and could predict the sentiment. Then by the help of tweeter API, we could retrive tweets from tweeter and analyze how the tweet feels.
You can take a look at tghe code and and run it on Jupyter notebook.
I will update this page for more details in case you have any questions.

As the second dataset is big and can not be uploaded here, use the google drive link to downlaod it.
